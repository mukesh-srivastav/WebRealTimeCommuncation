# WebRealTimeCommuncation

# Technologies Used:
 - JavaScript (Web RTC), Event handling, STUN/TURN Server, data packet handling. 
 - Node JS (Socket IO). 
 - HTML, CSS (UI). 

# Steps to use this:
  - Run `npm install`.  
  - Run `node index.js` (server).
  - Open localhost:8080 in browser, it will ask for meeting id aka room number.
  - Open localhost:8080 in next tab, it will ask for meeting id again. Put the same meeting id as previous once again. 
  - And both the screens are now joined in a bidirectional peer to peer real time communication in meeting room. You can see both of the screen's side by side on the page.

# Heroku: 
 - *https://safe-beach-57647.herokuapp.com/* .
 - Open the link in two tabs, put any number in both the tabs prompt as meeting id. 
 - And see each other connected peer to peer, side by side on the screen. Thanks.
